Note: Eclipse requires enabling annotation processor support installed
and enabled!  The m2e-apt plugin can be downloaded from the Eclipse
Marketplace or https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/m2e-apt (which
also has configuration instructions).  Ensure that Preferences ->
Maven -> Annotation Processing is set to "Automatically configure JDT
APT" or this will not work.
